<p>GhettoBox is a set of CSS micro-components for doing page layout. That’s it.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, it is akin to a CSS grid system. However, once you get to know it, you will see it can provide much more than that.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<iframe style="height: 520px;" class="w-fill" src="demo-animation/" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>GhettoBox is designed to fit into your template layer. It’s made for rapid page layout and prototyping and works nicely with <a href="http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup/">creating Mockups in Markup</a>.</p>

<div class="cs-2 pad-sm rnd-xs">

  <p><em>Note:</em> GhettoBox is not meant to be a replacement for your favorite framework. It should complement your existing tool-set while staying out of the way as much as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>GhettoBox is <em>only for layout</em>. That means if you use it, you will still need to create your own HTML/CSS components and styles. GhettoBox will be there to help you size, position, and resize your components.</p>

<h3 id="make-layout-easy">Make Layout Easy</h3>

<p>More than anything, GhettoBox strives to <strong>make layout easy</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, working with CSS can be a <a href="images/PPML.gif">finnicky, fidgety, frustrating, mess</a>. For any given task, there are a hundred different ways to go about it depending on context, preference, and browser support. They all break in there own special way.</p>

<p>We believe there is a better way. The theory being that by using <strong>less</strong> features of CSS, you can actually get <strong>more</strong> done with it.</p>

<p>GhettoBox takes the multitude of CSS layout options and narrows them down to a handful of primitives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="documentation/#padding">Padding</a></li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#tiling">Left-to-Right Placement</a></li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#widths">Widths</a></li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#alignment">Horizontal/Vertical Alignment</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You may think that this would be limiting - that it would not be enough to create elegant or complex page structures, but the truth is, if used properly, the above will get you over 90% of the way there (if not all of the way).</p>

<p>As an added bonus, GhettoBox throws in functionality for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Font Sizing</li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#equal-height-columns">Equal Height Columns</a></li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#responsive">Responsiveness</a></li>
  <li><a href="documentation/#source-ordering">Source Ordering</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>The project goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make HTML/CSS layout easy!</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t fight the document flow</li>
      <li>Keep it simple, stupid!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beginner friendly
    <ul>
      <li>Do not require the use of a preprocessor</li>
      <li>Stick to primitive, easy-to-follow components</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Only handle what’s directly related to layout
    <ul>
      <li>No widgets, dropdowns, popups, etc</li>
      <li>No scripting or behaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Promote a rapid workflow
    <ul>
      <li>One should be able to sketch out a page without writing any CSS</li>
      <li>Create your mockup in markup!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stay out of the way as much as possible
    <ul>
      <li>Classes adhere to a specificity level of one</li>
      <li>Limit global styling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-crazy">You Crazy</h2>

<p>GhettoBox is different from other CSS libraries. It may not meld with your idea of what qualifies as “proper CSS”.</p>

<p>We fully expect some people to hate on it. Haters gonna hate.</p>

<p>Give it a chance though - <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">just five minutes</a>. Even if you don’t end up using it for anything, GhettoBox involves thinking about page layout in a different way. At the very least, it will provide you with a fresh perspective on how CSS can be applied to HTML.</p>

<!-- 
## Motivation

One of the hardest parts of web development is getting elements to appear where and how you want them. CSS can be frustrating tool to work with - especially for beginners. It often acts in ways that are unintuitive or difficult to work around.

While flexbox and web components may be the future of HTML/CSS, for now, we designers and developers are stuck working within the limitations of browsers. GhettoBox is an easy-to-learn system that ...
 -->

<h2 id="whats-different">What’s different?</h2>

<p>Frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation have done a great job of sidestepping many of the problems in creating HTML/CSS designs. They’ve done this by providing pre-made, well-documented, reusable components which have allowed even inexperienced developers to jump right in and start creating.</p>

<p>They do however have some weak points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no built-in way of handling vertical/horizontal alignment</li>
  <li>implicitly add gutters (padding) to columns even though you may not want them</li>
  <li>require dividing columns up into a <code>.row</code>s so that they wrap nicely</li>
  <li>override your styling with specificity (e.g. <code>.navbar-nav &gt; li &gt; a</code>)</li>
  <li>have <em>tons</em> of variables in the preprocessor config code</li>
</ul>

<p>GhettoBox isn’t perfect either, but it does address the above. It is designed specifically for page layout and includes only simple micro-components.</p>

<p>If you have worked with a CSS preprocessor before, it may help to think about GhettoBox’s components like mix-ins - the difference being that you apply the mix-ins directly to HTML elements as opposed to being applied to CSS rules which are then used on HTML elements.</p>

<p>So why not just use mix-ins instead of mucking up our HTML? Here’s the short answer:</p>

<p>DOM Layout is inherently contextual. Changing the size/position of one element will affect the size/position of its sibling or parent elements. What’s nice about using class names as makeshift mix-ins (as opposed to preprocessor mix-ins) is that we don’t lose sight of the context we are working in. We are in the HTML and we can, at a glance, see how the changing of one element will interact with its surroundings.</p>

<p>There is of course nothing wrong with using mix-ins and/or preprocessors. It’s all about using the right tool for the job and we’ve found that when it comes to doing page layout, using pre-built classes generally makes life easier.</p>
